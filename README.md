# Intermediate Python Programming Workshop

This workshop is designed for social scientists who have some Python programming experience and want to deepen their knowledge and skills. The structure of this workshop is a bit different compared to the beginner workshop. Here we will assume that you have some working background knowledge in Python and have the ability to search for Python examples so that we can cover more material today.
